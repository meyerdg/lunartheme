1. Drop "Lunar.xml" into C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\themes 
or C:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes if your running 32 bit
or %APPDATA%\Notepad++\Themes if you don't have admin access to your machine (might need to create the Themes directory)

2. Open Notepad++.

3. Make sure you have the old GLua syntax highlighter installed.

( If you don't have it installed, then go to plugins >> plugin manager and find "Gmod LUA Lexer",
check it and install. Then close notepad++ and reopen it. )

4. Go to settings >> Style Configurator.

5. Under the select theme dropbox, choose Lunar.

6. Restart notepad++ if needed and your done!

NOTES:
________

-this WILL overwrite your default theme, no idea why but I am working on a fix

-if your text is surrounded with white highlighting you have to:
  1. go to settings >> style configurator
  2. go to "Global Override" >> in the second column check "enable global background color"

-if you want more contrast, just change the theme to "Deep Black".
